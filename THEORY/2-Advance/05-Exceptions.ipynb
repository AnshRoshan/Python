    "## 1. Introduction: Errors Happen!\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how carefully we code, errors are inevitable. They can range from simple typos to unexpected runtime conditions like network failures or invalid user input. Unhandled errors will crash your Python program, often leading to a poor user experience or data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception handling** is Python's mechanism for dealing with runtime errors in a controlled manner. It allows your program to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Detect** errors when they occur.\n",
    "2.  **Respond** appropriately (e.g., log the error, show a user-friendly message, try an alternative approach, perform cleanup actions).\n",
    "3.  **Continue** execution (if possible and appropriate) or terminate gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy: Safety Net**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your main program logic as a trapeze artist performing a routine. Exception handling is the safety net below. If the artist slips (an error occurs), the safety net (`except` block) catches them, preventing a crash. The routine might pause, the artist might reset (`finally` block actions), or the show might end early but safely, rather than resulting in disaster."

    "*   Occur *before* the program starts running, when the Python interpreter parses your code.\n",

    "*   Python cannot execute the code at all if a syntax error exists.\n",
    "*   You **cannot** catch Syntax Errors with `try...except` because the program doesn't even start running.\n",

    "*   **`Exception`:** The base class for most non-system-exiting errors. Catching this catches almost everything (but usually too broad).\n",
    "*   **`AttributeError`:** Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails (e.g., `obj.non_existent_attribute`).\n",
    "*   **`ImportError`:** Raised when an `import` statement fails to find the module or a name within the module.\n",
    "    *   **`ModuleNotFoundError`:** Subclass of `ImportError`, specifically when the module itself cannot be found (Python 3.6+).\n",
    "*   **`IndexError`:** Raised when a sequence subscript (index) is out of range (e.g., `my_list[10]` when list has only 5 elements).\n",
    "*   **`KeyError`:** Raised when a dictionary key is not found (e.g., `my_dict['non_existent_key']`).\n",
    "*   **`NameError`:** Raised when a local or global name (variable) is not found (e.g., using a variable before assigning it).\n",
    "*   **`FileNotFoundError`:** Raised when trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "*   **`OSError`:** Base class for many OS-related errors (file not found, permissions issues). `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, `ConnectionError` are subclasses.\n",
    "*   **`TypeError`:** Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type (e.g., `len(123)`, `'hello' + 5`).\n",
    "*   **`ValueError`:** Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value (e.g., `int('abc')`, `my_list.remove('non_existent_value')`).\n",
    "*   **`ZeroDivisionError`:** Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.\n",
    "*   **`KeyboardInterrupt`:** Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (usually Ctrl+C).\n",
    "*   **`SystemExit`:** Raised by the `sys.exit()` function. Not usually caught unless for specific cleanup.\n",

    "## 7. The `with` Statement (Context Managers)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Objects used in a `with` statement are called **context managers**. They must implement two special methods:\n",
    "*   `__enter__(self)`: Executed when entering the `with` block. Can return an object to be used inside the block (assigned to the `as` variable).\n",
    "*   `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`: Executed when exiting the `with` block (either normally or due to an exception).\n",
    "    *   `exc_type`, `exc_val`, `exc_tb`: Hold the exception type, value, and traceback if an exception occurred within the `with` block; otherwise, they are `None`.\n",
    "    *   If `__exit__` returns `True`, the exception is suppressed (considered handled). If it returns `False` (or `None`), the exception continues to propagate after `__exit__` finishes.\n",

    "## 8. Best Practices & Enterprise Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Be Specific:** Catch the most specific exceptions you anticipate, rather than broad `except Exception:` or bare `except:`.\n",
    "2.  **Don't Swallow Exceptions:** Avoid empty `except:` blocks or `except: pass`. If you catch an exception, handle it meaningfully (log it, inform the user, retry, clean up) or re-raise it.\n",
    "3.  **Use `finally` for Cleanup:** Guarantee resource release (closing files, unlocking mutexes) in `finally` or, preferably, use context managers (`with`).\n",
    "4.  **Use Custom Exceptions:** Define custom exceptions for domain-specific errors to improve code clarity and allow targeted handling.\n",
    "5.  **Log Exceptions:** Always log exceptions (ideally with tracebacks using `logging.exception` or `logging.error(..., exc_info=True)`) before handling or re-raising them. This is critical for debugging in production.\n",
    "6.  **Provide Context:** When raising exceptions (especially custom ones), include relevant information in the message or as attributes on the exception object.\n",
    "7.  **Error Reporting:** In applications, translate exceptions into user-friendly error messages or error codes. Don't expose raw tracebacks to end-users (security risk).\n",
    "8.  **Fail Fast (Often):** In many cases, it's better to let unexpected errors propagate up (and be caught by a top-level handler) than to guess how to recover deep within the code.\n",
    "9.  **Consider Retries (Carefully):** For transient errors (like temporary network issues), implement a retry mechanism with backoff, but avoid infinite retries.\n",
    "10. **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify that your code raises the correct exceptions under specific conditions and that your `except` blocks handle them as expected."

    "\n",
    "**Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Bare `except:`:** Catches *everything*, including `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, making it hard to terminate the program and hiding the real errors.\n",
    "*   **`except Exception:`:** Still quite broad. Better to catch specific subclasses unless it's a generic fallback handler.\n",
    "*   **Swallowing Errors (`except: pass`):** Hides problems, making debugging impossible.\n",
    "*   **Incorrect `except` Order:** If a base class exception (like `Exception`) is caught *before* a more specific subclass (like `ValueError`), the specific block will never be reached.\n",
    "*   **Resource Leaks:** Forgetting to close files or release resources if not using `finally` or `with`.\n",
    "*   **Raising Generic `Exception`:** Prefer raising more specific built-in or custom exceptions.\n",
    "*   **Performance Impact:** While necessary, `try...except` blocks do have a small performance overhead. Avoid using them excessively for non-exceptional control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Interview Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is the difference between a Syntax Error and an Exception in Python?\n",
    "2.  Explain the purpose of the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` clauses.\n",
    "3.  Why is it generally bad practice to use a bare `except:`?\n",
    "4.  How do you access the exception object within an `except` block?\n",
    "5.  How can you catch multiple specific exceptions in a single `except` block?\n",
    "6.  What does the `raise` keyword do? How can you re-raise an exception?\n",
    "7.  Why would you define custom exceptions? How do you do it?\n",
    "8.  What is the `with` statement used for, and how does it relate to exception handling?\n",
    "9.  Name some common built-in Python exceptions and when they occur (`TypeError`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`, `IndexError`, `FileNotFoundError`).\n",
    "10. How should exceptions be logged effectively?\n",
    "11. What is the difference between `Exception` and `BaseException`? (BaseException is the ultimate base, includes system-exiting exceptions like KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit. Usually catch Exception or specific subclasses)."

    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Write a function that reads data from a file, performs a simple calculation, and handles potential errors robustly.\n",

    "**File Format:** Assume a file (`data.txt`) where each line contains a number (integer or float).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create Sample Files:**\n",
    "    *   `data_ok.txt`: Contains valid numbers (e.g., `10\\n20.5\\n-5\\n`).\n",
    "    *   `data_bad.txt`: Contains a mix of valid numbers and invalid lines (e.g., `10\\nhello\\n30\\n`).\n",
    "    *   Ensure one file (`data_missing.txt`) does not exist.\n",
    "2.  **Define Custom Exception:** Create a custom exception `FileProcessingError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n",
    "3.  **Write `parse_and_sum(filepath: str) -> float` function:**\n",
    "    *   Takes the file path as input.\n",
    "    *   Uses a `try...except...finally` structure.\n",
    "    *   Opens and reads the file line by line **using a `with` statement**.\n",
    "    *   For each line:\n",
    "        *   Attempts to convert the line (strip whitespace first!) to a float.\n",
    "        *   If conversion fails (`ValueError`), logs a warning with the line number and content, and skips the line.\n",
    "        *   Adds the valid number to a running total.\n",
    "    *   Handles `FileNotFoundError` by logging an error and raising your custom `FileProcessingError` containing an informative message and the original exception (`from e`).\n",
    "    *   Handles `IOError` (or `OSError`) during file operations similarly, raising `FileProcessingError from e`.\n",
    "    *   The `finally` block should log a message indicating whether processing finished or was interrupted by an error.\n",
    "    *   Returns the calculated sum if successful.\n",
    "4.  **Test:** Call your function with the different file paths (`data_ok.txt`, `data_bad.txt`, `data_missing.txt`) and wrap these calls in another `try...except` block to catch the potential `FileProcessingError` and print appropriate messages."

    "## 11. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust error and exception handling is non-negotiable for reliable software. Python's `try...except...else...finally` structure, combined with specific exception catching, custom exception types, and the `with` statement for resource management, provides a powerful toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By anticipating potential errors, handling them gracefully, logging appropriately, and using custom exceptions for clarity, you can build applications that are more resilient, easier to debug, and provide a better experience for users even when things go wrong. Remember that exception handling is not just about preventing crashes; it's about managing failure in a controlled and informative way."
