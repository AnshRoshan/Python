    "# ðŸ“¦ Mastering Context Managers in Python: The Power of `with`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome!** Context managers are a key feature in Python for reliable resource management. They provide a structured way to ensure resources (like files, network connections, locks) are properly set up and, more importantly, always torn down, even when errors occur. This notebook explores how to use and create context managers using both classes and the `contextlib` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience:** Python developers seeking to write more robust, reliable, and cleaner code by effectively managing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand the problem context managers solve (resource cleanup, setup/teardown).\n",
    "*   Master the use of the `with` statement.\n",
    "*   Implement the context management protocol using class-based managers (`__enter__`, `__exit__`).\n",
    "*   Handle exceptions correctly within the `__exit__` method.\n",
    "*   Create concise context managers using `contextlib.contextmanager` and generator functions.\n",
    "*   Explore other utilities in `contextlib` (`closing`, `suppress`, `redirect_stdout`, etc.).\n",
    "*   Understand best practices and common use cases for context managers."

    "\n",
    "Many programming tasks involve working with resources that need explicit setup and teardown:\n",
    "*   **Files:** Need to be opened and *always* closed, even if errors happen during processing.\n",

    "with expression as variable: # 'as variable' is optional\n",
    "    # Code block where the resource acquired by 'expression' is available\n",
    "    # Use 'variable' (if provided) to interact with the resource\n",

    "Using `try...finally` is like manually cleaning your oven after every use â€“ effective but tedious. The `with` statement is like having a self-cleaning oven. You put your food in (`__enter__`), use it (`with` block), and when you're done (exiting the block), the oven automatically runs its cleaning cycle (`__exit__`), even if you accidentally burned the food (an error occurred)."

    "    *   Called when the `with` statement is entered.\n",
    "    *   Responsible for setting up the resource (e.g., opening the file, acquiring the lock).\n",
    "    *   The return value of `__enter__` is assigned to the variable after `as` in the `with` statement. If you don't need a variable, it can return `None` or `self`.\n",

    "2.  **`object.__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`:**\n",
    "    *   Called when execution leaves the `with` block, either normally or due to an exception.\n",
    "    *   Responsible for tearing down the resource (e.g., closing the file, releasing the lock).\n",
    "    *   **Exception Handling:**\n",
    "        *   If the `with` block completed without an exception, `exc_type`, `exc_value`, and `traceback` will all be `None`.\n",
    "        *   If an exception occurred, these arguments contain the exception details (type, instance, traceback object).\n",
    "        *   The `__exit__` method can inspect these arguments and decide how to handle the exception.\n",
    "        *   **Return Value:** If `__exit__` returns `True`, the exception is considered handled (suppressed), and execution continues normally after the `with` block. If it returns `False` (or implicitly `None`), any exception that occurred is re-raised after `__exit__` completes."

    "## 6. Best Practices & Enterprise Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Use `with` Whenever Possible:** For any object that supports the protocol (files, locks, network/DB connections, executors), use the `with` statement for guaranteed resource cleanup.\n",
    "2.  **Prefer `contextlib.contextmanager`:** For simple setup/teardown logic, the decorator is often more concise and readable than a full class.\n",
    "3.  **Class-Based for Complex State:** Use a class-based context manager if you need to maintain significant state between `__enter__` and `__exit__` or provide multiple methods on the context object itself.\n",
    "4.  **Handle Exceptions Appropriately in `__exit__`:** Decide consciously whether to suppress (`return True`) or propagate (`return False`/`None`/re-raise) exceptions occurring in the `with` block.\n",
    "5.  **Ensure Cleanup Robustness:** The code in `finally` (for `@contextmanager`) or `__exit__` must be robust and ideally should not raise new exceptions itself (or handle them internally).\n",
    "6.  **Idempotency:** Ensure `__exit__` can be safely called even if `__enter__` failed partially (though `with` usually prevents this).\n",
    "7.  **Resource Pooling:** In enterprise applications, database or network connections are often managed by pools, which themselves might act as context managers or provide resources that are context managers."

    "**Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "*   **Not using `with`:** Leading to resource leaks (files not closed, locks not released).\n",
    "*   **Incorrect `__exit__` Logic:** Failing to release resources, especially when exceptions occur.\n",
    "*   **Swallowing Exceptions:** Returning `True` from `__exit__` inappropriately, hiding errors from the caller.\n",
    "*   **Errors in `__enter__` or `__exit__`:** The setup/teardown code itself can fail.\n",
    "*   **Blocking Operations in `__exit__`:** Performing long-running tasks during cleanup can delay program termination or subsequent operations.\n",

    "**Common Interview Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What problem does the `with` statement solve in Python?\n",
    "2.  What two methods must an object implement to be a context manager?\n",
    "3.  Explain the purpose and arguments of the `__exit__` method.\n",
    "4.  How can the `__exit__` method suppress an exception that occurred inside the `with` block?\n",
    "5.  How can you create a context manager using a generator function? (Mention `contextlib.contextmanager`).\n",
    "6.  Give examples of built-in Python objects that are context managers.\n",
    "7.  Why is using `with` generally preferred over manual `try...finally` for resource management?"

    "## 8. Challenge: Database Transaction Context Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a context manager (using either a class or `contextlib`) that simulates managing a database transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Simulated DB Connection:** Create a dummy class `DatabaseConnection` with methods `connect()`, `close()`, `begin_transaction()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` that print messages indicating their action.\n",
    "2.  **Create Context Manager (`transaction`):**\n",
    "    *   Implement a context manager (either class-based or using `@contextlib.contextmanager`) named `transaction`.\n",
    "    *   It should accept a `DatabaseConnection` object during initialization (`__init__` or as an argument to the generator function).\n",
    "    *   **`__enter__` / Setup:** Call the connection's `begin_transaction()` method.\n",
    "    *   **`__exit__` / Teardown:**\n",
    "        *   If no exception occurred (`exc_type` is `None`), call the connection's `commit()` method.\n",
    "        *   If an exception *did* occur, call the connection's `rollback()` method.\n",
    "        *   Ensure the exception is *not* suppressed (it should propagate out of the `with` block).\n",
    "3.  **Test:**\n",
    "    *   Create an instance of `DatabaseConnection`.\n",
    "    *   Use your `transaction` context manager with the connection object.\n",
    "    *   Inside the `with` block, simulate some database operations (e.g., print messages like \"Executing query 1...\").\n",
    "    *   Run a test case where the `with` block completes successfully.\n",
    "    *   Run another test case where an exception is raised inside the `with` block.\n",
    "    *   Verify from the printed messages that `commit()` is called on success and `rollback()` is called on error."

    "Context managers, used via the `with` statement, are an indispensable feature of modern Python for ensuring reliable resource management. Whether you're working with files, network connections, locks, or implementing custom setup/teardown logic, context managers provide a clean, readable, and robust way to guarantee that necessary cleanup actions are always performed.\n",
