    "# üêç Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
    "**Welcome!** This notebook is your comprehensive guide to understanding and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. We'll explore the core concepts, best practices, and enterprise-level considerations that make OOP a powerful paradigm for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software.\n",
    "**Target Audience:** Beginners to intermediate Python developers looking to solidify their OOP foundations and understand its application in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand the fundamental principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "*   Learn how to define classes, create objects, and implement methods (`__init__`, instance methods, `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`).\n",
    "*   Grasp the importance of data hiding and access control (Encapsulation).\n",
    "*   Implement inheritance hierarchies for code reuse and specialization.\n",
    "*   Leverage polymorphism for flexible and extensible designs.\n",
    "*   Understand Abstraction using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).\n",
    "*   Incorporate enterprise best practices: Logging, Type Hinting, Docstrings, Basic Testing, and Dependency Injection concepts.\n",
    "*   Identify common pitfalls and prepare for related interview questions."

    "## 1. Introduction: What is OOP and Why Use It?\n",
    "**Analogy: The Car Factory**\n",
    "Imagine a car factory. Instead of building every single car from scratch with unique instructions, the factory uses **blueprints** (Classes) to define the common structure and capabilities of a car (e.g., engine, wheels, doors, accelerate, brake). Each car rolling off the assembly line is an **instance** (Object) built from that blueprint. While all cars share the blueprint's design, each can have unique characteristics (color, VIN number - *attributes*) and perform actions (accelerate, brake - *methods*).\n",
    "**Core Idea:** OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "**Key Benefits in Enterprise Software:**\n",
    "1.  **Modularity:** Objects are self-contained units. This makes complex systems easier to manage and understand.\n",
    "2.  **Reusability:** Inheritance allows classes to reuse code from parent classes, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "3.  **Maintainability:** Changes within one object/class are less likely to break unrelated parts of the system (if designed well). Encapsulation helps protect internal state.\n",
    "4.  **Scalability:** Modular design makes it easier to add new features or components without rewriting existing code.\n",
    "5.  **Collaboration:** Different teams can work on different objects/components relatively independently."

    "*   **Object (Instance):** A specific realization created from a class. It has its own state (values for its attributes) and can perform actions defined by the class's methods."

    "**Concept:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (the class). Crucially, it also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a key principle for preventing accidental modification of data (data hiding).\n",
    "**Python's Approach:**\n",
    "*   **No strict `private` keyword:** Python relies on conventions.\n",
    "*   **`_` (Single Underscore - Protected):** Convention indicating an attribute or method is intended for internal use or use by subclasses. It's a hint to developers, but *not* enforced by the interpreter.\n",
    "*   **`__` (Double Underscore - \"Private\" / Name Mangling):** Attributes or methods starting with `__` (and without trailing `__`) undergo *name mangling*. Python changes the name to `_ClassName__attributeName`. This makes it harder (but not impossible) to access directly from outside the class, primarily to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.\n",

It *exposes* controls like the steering wheel, accelerator, and speedometer (`public` methods/properties), but it *hides* the complex engine mechanics and wiring (`protected`/`private` implementation details).

    "## 8. Pitfalls and Common Interview Questions\n",
    "**Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "1.  **Mutable Default Arguments:** Using mutable types (lists, dicts) as default values in `__init__` or methods. The default is shared across calls/instances, leading to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Bad example:\n",
    "    # def __init__(self, name, items=[]): self.items = items # items will be shared!\n",
    "    # Correct:\n",
    "    # def __init__(self, name, items=None): self.items = items if items is not None else []\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Misunderstanding `super()`:** Incorrectly calling or omitting `super().__init__()` in subclasses, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios (MRO - Method Resolution Order).\n",
    "3.  **Confusing `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`:** Using one when the other is appropriate. Remember: `@classmethod` gets `cls`, `@staticmethod` gets neither `self` nor `cls`.\n",
    "4.  **Overriding vs Overloading:** Python doesn't support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types) like Java/C++. It uses overriding (subclass provides its own implementation of a parent method). Default arguments or `*args/**kwargs` achieve flexibility.\n",
    "5.  **Ignoring Encapsulation:** Directly accessing `_protected` or `__private` attributes from outside the class unnecessarily.\n",
    "6.  **Choosing Inheritance when Composition is Better:** Forcing an \"IS-A\" relationship when a \"HAS-A\" relationship is more suitable and flexible.\n",
    "**Common OOP Interview Questions:**\n",
    "1.  Explain the four main pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) with examples.\n",
    "2.  What is a class? What is an object?\n",
    "3.  Explain `__init__`, `self`.\n",
    "4.  What is inheritance? What are its benefits and drawbacks?\n",
    "5.  What is `super()` used for?\n",
    "6.  Explain polymorphism in Python. What is Duck Typing?\n",
    "7.  What is encapsulation? How is it achieved in Python (`_`, `__`, properties)?\n",
    "8.  What is abstraction? How do Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) work?\n",
    "9.  What is the difference between `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`? When would you use each?\n",
    "10. What are `__str__` and `__repr__` used for?\n",
    "11. What is the difference between Composition and Inheritance? When prefer one over the other?\n",
    "12. What are SOLID principles? (Explain one or two).\n",
    "13. What is Dependency Injection? Why is it useful?"
