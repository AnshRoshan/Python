    "# ðŸ§± Building Scalable Python Applications: Modules and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome!** As Python projects grow, organizing code becomes paramount. This notebook delves into Python's fundamental organizational structures: **Modules** and **Packages**. Understanding how to create, import, and structure them is essential for writing maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience:** Python developers moving beyond single-file scripts, aiming to build larger, well-structured applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand what constitutes a Python module and how to create one.\n",
    "*   Master various import statements (`import`, `from ... import`, aliasing).\n",
    "*   Learn how Python finds modules (`sys.path`).\n",
    "*   Understand package structure and the role of `__init__.py`.\n",
    "*   Differentiate between and use absolute and relative imports.\n",
    "*   Explore modern packaging concepts (namespace packages, `pyproject.toml`).\n",
    "*   Learn best practices for organizing projects and managing dependencies.\n",
    "*   Identify common pitfalls like circular imports and namespace pollution."

    "## 1. Introduction: Why Organize Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine writing a large book as one single, massive paragraph. It would be impossible to read, navigate, or edit. Similarly, writing large software applications in a single file becomes unmanageable quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's modules and packages provide mechanisms to break down code into logical, reusable units, offering several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Organization:** Group related code (functions, classes, variables) together, making the project structure clear and understandable.\n",
    "*   **Reusability:** Write code once in a module and import it wherever needed, avoiding repetition (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "*   **Maintainability:** Changes made within one module are less likely to break unrelated parts of the application (if designed well).\n",
    "*   **Namespace Management:** Avoid naming conflicts between different parts of your code. Each module has its own private namespace.\n",
    "*   **Collaboration:** Different developers can work on different modules/packages simultaneously with fewer conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy: The Toolbox and Workshop**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A **Module** is like a specialized tool or a small set of related tools (e.g., a screwdriver set - `screwdrivers.py`) stored in a file.\n",
    "*   A **Package** is like a drawer or a section in your workshop (a directory) that holds multiple toolsets (modules) and possibly smaller organizers (subpackages), all related to a specific task (e.g., a `woodworking` package containing `chisels.py`, `saws.py`, and a `fasteners` subpackage).\n",
    "*   The `__init__.py` file acts like the label on the drawer, identifying it as a package and potentially listing the main tools available directly from the drawer label.\n",
    "*   **Importing** is like taking a specific tool (`import screwdrivers`) or a specific type of screwdriver (`from screwdrivers import phillips_head`) out of the toolbox to use it."

    "## 3. Packages: Organizing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Package?**\n",
    "A package is a way to structure Python's module namespace using directories. It's essentially a directory containing:\n",
    "1.  One or more module files (`.py`).\n",
    "2.  Possibly other sub-packages (subdirectories also containing an `__init__.py`).\n",
    "3.  An `__init__.py` file (even if empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 The Role of `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file has several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Marker:** Historically (before Python 3.3), its presence marked a directory as a Python package, distinguishing it from a regular directory that shouldn't be importable.\n",
    "2.  **Initialization:** Code in `__init__.py` is executed *the first time* the package or any of its modules are imported. This can be used for package-level setup (though complex setup is often better done elsewhere).\n",
    "3.  **Namespace Control:** It can define what symbols are available when importing the package directly (e.g., `import mypackage`).\n",
    "4.  **Convenience Imports:** It can import selected functions/classes from its submodules, making them available at the top level of the package (e.g., allowing `from mypackage import useful_function` instead of `from mypackage.submodule import useful_function`).\n",
    "5.  **`__all__`:** Define a list named `__all__` in `__init__.py` to specify exactly what names should be imported when `from mypackage import *` is used. This overrides the default behavior of importing all names not starting with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Note (Namespace Packages):** Since Python 3.3, directories *without* an `__init__.py` can also be treated as **namespace packages**. These allow splitting a single logical package across multiple directories (useful for large libraries or plugins). However, for standard package creation within a single project, including an `__init__.py` (even if empty) remains common practice and necessary if you want initialization code or to use `__all__`."

    "### 4.1 Absolute vs. Relative Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Absolute Imports:** Specify the full path from the project's root directory (or a directory in `sys.path`). Preferred for clarity and robustness, especially in applications and larger libraries.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import mypackage.core_logic\n",
    "    from mypackage.utils import helpers\n",
    "    from mypackage.utils.helpers import format_output\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Relative Imports:** Use dots (`.`) to indicate relative position *within the same package*. Useful for making packages more self-contained and easier to rename or move.\n",
    "    *   `.`: Current directory (where the importing module resides).\n",
    "    *   `..`: Parent directory.\n",
    "    *   `...`: Grandparent directory, etc.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Inside mypackage/core_logic.py:\n",
    "    from . import utils           # Import utils subpackage from the same level\n",
    "    from .utils import helpers   # Import helpers module from utils subpackage\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Rule:** Relative imports can **only** be used within modules that are part of a package. You **cannot** use them in top-level scripts that are run directly (files whose `__name__` is `'__main__'`). Trying to do so results in `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`.\n",

    "### 4.2 Common Import Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Circular Imports:** Occur when Module A imports Module B, and Module B imports Module A (directly or indirectly). Python's import mechanism can usually handle simple cases, but complex circular dependencies often lead to `ImportError` or `AttributeError` because one module might try to access a name from the other before it has been fully initialized.\n",
    "    *   **Solution:** Refactor code. Move shared dependencies to a third module, import modules only within functions where needed (lazy import - less ideal), or rethink the overall structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Namespace Pollution:** Using `from module import *` dumps all names from the imported module into the current namespace, potentially overwriting existing names and making it hard to track the origin of functions/variables.\n",
    "    *   **Solution:** Avoid star imports. Use `import module` or `from module import specific_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Shadowing Built-ins or Standard Library Modules:** Naming your own module or variable the same as a Python built-in (e.g., `str.py`, `list.py`) or a standard library module (e.g., `math.py`, `email.py`) can prevent you from importing the original.\n",
    "    *   **Solution:** Choose unique and descriptive names for your modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Side Effects in Modules:** Code at the top level of a module (outside functions/classes) runs *when the module is first imported*. Avoid complex operations or operations with significant side effects (like connecting to databases, modifying global state extensively) at the module's top level. Put such code in functions or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Mutable Objects as Module Globals:** If a module defines a global variable that is a mutable object (like a list or dict), changes made to it by one importer will be seen by all other importers of that module, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "    *   **Solution:** Be cautious with mutable globals. Prefer passing state explicitly or managing it within classes."

    "## 5. Best Practices and Modern Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **PEP 8 Import Guidelines:**\n",
    "    *   Imports should usually be on separate lines.\n",
    "    *   Group imports in this order: Standard library, related third-party, local application/library specific.\n",
    "    *   Use absolute imports generally.\n",
    "    *   Avoid wildcard imports (`from ... import *`).\n",
    "    *   Use tools like `isort` or formatters like `black` to automatically manage import order and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Using `__all__`:** Explicitly define `__all__` in your `__init__.py` files if you want to control what `from package import *` does, or simply as a way to document the public API of the package/module.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Namespace Packages (Python 3.3+):** Useful for large libraries or plugins that might be installed independently but contribute to the same top-level package namespace. They allow directories without `__init__.py` to be part of the package path. Less common for typical application structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Virtual Environments:** **Absolutely essential.** Always use virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`) to isolate project dependencies. This prevents conflicts between different projects requiring different versions of the same library.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # Create a virtual environment (using venv)\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv \n",
    "    # Activate it (Linux/macOS)\n",
    "    source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    # Activate it (Windows - Git Bash/WSL)\n",
    "    # source .venv/Scripts/activate\n",
    "    # Activate it (Windows - Cmd/PowerShell)\n",
    "    # .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat \n",
    "    # .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Install packages (they go into the venv)\n",
    "    pip install requests\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Deactivate when done\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Editable Installs (`pip install -e .`):** During development of a package, install it in 'editable' mode. This creates links in `site-packages` pointing back to your source code, so changes you make are immediately reflected without needing to reinstall after every edit.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # In your project's root directory (containing pyproject.toml or setup.py)\n",
    "    # Ensure your virtual environment is active\n",
    "    pip install -e .\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Packaging and Distribution (`pyproject.toml`):** For sharing your package or installing it cleanly, define its metadata, dependencies, and build system in a `pyproject.toml` file (modern standard replacing `setup.py` for most configurations). Use tools like `pip`, `build`, `twine`, or higher-level managers like `Poetry` or `Hatch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Type Hinting:** Use type hints within your modules and packages to improve code clarity, enable static analysis (with tools like `mypy`), and enhance editor support."

    "## 8. Challenge: Create a Simple Calculator Package\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Build a basic calculator package with separate modules for operations and history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create Package Structure:**\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    calculator/\n",
    "    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py\n",
    "    â”œâ”€â”€ operations.py\n",
    "    â””â”€â”€ history.py \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Implement `operations.py`:**\n",
    "    *   Define functions `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, `divide(a, b)`.\n",
    "    *   The `divide` function should handle `ZeroDivisionError` gracefully (e.g., return `float('inf')` or `None` and log a warning).\n",
    "3.  **Implement `history.py`:**\n",
    "    *   Define a global list (e.g., `_calculation_history = []`) to store calculation records (be mindful of mutable globals - perhaps better in a class, but a list is okay for this simple challenge).\n",
    "    *   Define a function `add_to_history(operation: str, a, b, result)` that appends a formatted string or tuple representing the calculation to the `_calculation_history` list.\n",
    "    *   Define a function `get_history()` that returns a copy of the history list.\n",
    "    *   Define a function `clear_history()`.\n",
    "4.  **Implement `calculator/__init__.py`:**\n",
    "    *   Import the core operation functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) from `.operations`.\n",
    "    *   Import the history functions (`get_history`, `clear_history`) from `.history`.\n",
    "    *   Use `__all__` to define the public API of the `calculator` package (e.g., `['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'get_history', 'clear_history']`).\n",
    "5.  **Write Test Script (`test_calculator.py` - outside the package):**\n",
    "    *   Import the `calculator` package.\n",
    "    *   Perform several calculations using the imported functions (e.g., `calculator.add(5, 3)`, `calculator.divide(10, 2)`, `calculator.divide(5, 0)`).\n",
    "    *   **Modify `operations.py`:** Make sure the operation functions call `history.add_to_history` (using a relative import like `from . import history`) *before* returning the result.\n",
    "    *   Print the calculation history using `calculator.get_history()`.\n",
    "    *   Clear the history and verify it's empty.\n",
